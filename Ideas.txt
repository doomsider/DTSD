Ideas for features for starmaded:
 - The ability for the !GIVESET command to read the block config
 - Add in the use of the box function for general commands
 - Fleet system (needs new command before it can be fully implimented)
 - SQL Management (stats,online,faction)
 - added to a limit of ping  (ping_limit: 500)

Advanced/looking into:
 - Use of the uplink data to inform users when they recieve a starmadedock mail message? <will run by resba and schema>
