Planned/ideas for features for starmaded:
 - The ability for the !GIVESET command to read the block config
 - Cleaned up code, using source to get variables from files
 - Add in the use of the box function for general commands
 - Faction points, gained for faction activity and used for various systems (jump and warp mabey?)
 - A custom spawning system, using plex storages as payment for the ships (as soon as blueprint and inventory commands are added)
 - Variable shutdown timer for use in the sm_stop command
 - New gamemodes (Hardcore and race for credits)
 - Fleet system (needs new command before it can be fully implimented)
 - Faction points for activity
 - Kit store for voting points
 - Voting points/faction points exchange
 
Advanced/looking into:
 - Wrapper functionality (packet interception) <will run by schema>
 - Inter-server mail system <will run by schema>
 - Inter-server war system <will run by schema>
 - Ingame chat linked to IRC channel for the server
 - Use of the uplink data to inform users when they recieve a starmadedock mail message? <will run by resba and schema>
